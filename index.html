<p>My name is Sun Hee Choi and I am from South Korea originally.  However, I moved to a little town outside of Berlin in Germany when I was five years old and spent 5-6 years.  I eventually moved to Malaysia for late middle school and high school after moving back to South Korea for college.  I have a background in fashion and graphic design and am aiming to get into UX / UI design post-BMCC and look forward to learning more in this class!</p>
